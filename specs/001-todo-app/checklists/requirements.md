# Specification Quality Checklist: Console To-Do Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-01
**Feature**: [specs/001-todo-app/spec.md](../../specs/001-todo-app/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)  <!-- Note: Technology stack section added with Python and UV -->
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification  <!-- Note: Technology stack section added with Python and UV -->

## Notes

- Most validation items have been completed successfully
- Technology stack section added with implementation details (Python and UV package manager)
- Specification is ready for the planning phase
