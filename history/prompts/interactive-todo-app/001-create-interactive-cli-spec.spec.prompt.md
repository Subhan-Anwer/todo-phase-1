# Create Interactive CLI Spec

## Prompt Text

Interactive CLI To-Do Application

## Response Text

Successfully created the specification for the Interactive CLI To-Do Application. The specification includes:

- User stories for interactive menu navigation, task addition, task listing, task completion, and task management
- Functional requirements covering menu navigation, task operations, and backward compatibility
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes for user experience and system reliability
- Edge cases for error handling and user interaction scenarios
- Key entities for the interactive system

The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase. It maintains backward compatibility with existing command-line functionality while adding the requested interactive menu system with arrow-key navigation.

## Outcome

The specification document (spec.md) and quality checklist (requirements.md) have been created in the feature directory. The feature branch 001-interactive-todo-app has been created and checked out. The specification is ready for planning and implementation.
